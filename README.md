Clio
====

A command-line tool for managing Visual Studio project files.

Usage
-----

`clio list` - prints a list of the files in the top level directory. Options:
 * `-f` full listing.
 * `-p <path>` start at this path.

`clio contains <file>` - whether or not a file is included in the project.

`clio add <action> <file>` - adds a file to the project.

*Caveat lector - very much a work in progress!*
